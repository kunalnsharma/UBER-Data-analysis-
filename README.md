üöñ Ride-Hailing Data Analysis

This project analyzes ride-hailing dataset (similar to Uber/Ola) to generate business, operational, and customer insights.
The analysis covers booking trends, cancellations, driver/customer behavior, revenue insights, and ratings.

üìå Project Overview

Dataset contains booking details with features like:

Date, Time, Booking ID, Booking Status

Customer ID, Vehicle Type, Pickup & Drop Location

Avg VTAT (Vehicle Turn Around Time), Avg CTAT (Customer Turn Around Time)

Booking Value, Ride Distance, Ratings, Payment Method, etc.

The goal of this project is to identify patterns and insights for improving efficiency, reducing cancellations, and enhancing customer experience.
